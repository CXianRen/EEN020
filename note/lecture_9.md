# what is the problem we are gonna solve in this lecture ?

+ because the solution returned by RANSAC is not the bset solution.

## Model fitting task

### fitting example
+ Least Squares Line Fitting
+ Total Least Squares Line Fitting
  + (derivation process?)
  + what does a and b mean?

### Handling Nose
+ how ?
  + we want to minimize the error.

+ how is error defined?
  + The reporjection error.
    $\| x_{1,2} - P(X)_{1,2}\|^2 $
    + distance between reprojected point and actual  point on the image plane.
    + (? why it is non linear ?)
  + Algebraic (/ˌæl.dʒəˈbreɪ.ɪk/) Error
    + $\| \lambda x - P(X)\|^2 $
      + 3 dimentions !!!!
